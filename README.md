swampr - a basic blogging app in Flask 
=======================================


This is an app we're using to learn Flask.  These are the components that make up the application:

-Skeleton Flask files to launch the app (we begin with "Hello, world!") 
-A model class that declares our classes (Post and User)
-A forms file that defines forms for adding new users and adding new posts.
